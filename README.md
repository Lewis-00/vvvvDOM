# vvvvDOM Project

This project is a personal exploration into building a **virtual DOM** from scratch,
inspired by the inner workings of frameworks like **React**. The goal is to deepen my understanding of how the virtual
DOM operates and how it can be used to optimize the rendering process in web applications

## Inspiration

I've taken a inspiration from **Jason Yu**, a software engineer, who has shared his insights on the virtual DOM

## Key Details

- The variables starting with `$` represent **real DOM elements**.
- The variables starting with `v` represent **virtual DOM nodes**.
